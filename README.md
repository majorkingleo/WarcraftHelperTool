This is a LAN helper Tool for Warcraft III.

When creating a LAN game w3.exe will send a UDP broadcast over the network on port 6112, 
so the server can be found by other players. It depends on your windows version, and your applied
network adapter if this UDP broadcast is sent to every connected network.

This Tool records the sent UDP packet and resends on any other network interface that is found 
on your computer.

So Anyone will find your hosted game.
